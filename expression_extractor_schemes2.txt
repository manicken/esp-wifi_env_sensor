think i know how i should be done now:
have a flush function that can pop/push(move) tokens from one stack to annother
until the source is either empty or a leftparenthesis is found

clearly separate out the calc rpn and logic rpn:

no seperate tempStack that is at root instead utilize LogicRPNNode:
std::vector<ExpressionToken*> tempStack;
instead have:
std::vector<LogicRPNNode*> tempStack;

first create the root object LogicRPNNode:

use this root object:s std::vector<ExpressionToken*> calcRPN
to use as the current outstack
