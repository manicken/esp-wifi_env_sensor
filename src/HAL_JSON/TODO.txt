fix ReadAndParseScriptFile and ParseScript
so that they can be reused for both:
Validate
and
LoadScript

but as validate have some validate functions
that should not be executed while LoadScript
then there need to be separate functions that somehow share the functionality

think a callback that takes a TokenArray as parameter can be used
so the basic load/needed fixes are allways present
such as newline fix and comment removal

make the rules/scripts file loader aware of comments such as // and /* */
to save ram usage while loading rules/scripts

maybe the json cfg file could also use this principe then it would be possible to have real comments in the json cfg files


maybe make rule tokenizer and pre fixin such as comment removing + newline fixin is in separeate file



implement so that GlobalLogger includes a websocket server, so that if any client is connected then the log gets automatically printed 

test TX433
test REGO600

make it so that if a device is not found while read/write it sends back that as a proper error
think this is done?

Refactor CommandExecutor so that all errors is added to GlobalLogger instead of the message which 
should only be used when values are read
all commands that execute without any problems just returns true

Convert all JSON validation errors to use an error code system for improved memory efficiency.
Note: This is partially implemented—currently, F("") strings are used, which keeps the string data in flash memory, so the tradeoff is extra used flash memory.

change GPIO_manager into a "static" class namespace so that we can hide functions/variables

implement a global defines that can be switched on/off
  #define HAL_JSON_VALIDATE_FAIL_OPERATION continue
  #define HAL_JSON_VALIDATE_FAIL_OPERATION return false
so that "if one fail" -> "all fail" principe can be used"

fix Operations so that a read string request can have a json string command scheme --- done!
fix UID_Path so that multilevel paths can be used --- done!

refactor the use of webserver in gpio_manager, either into a separate file or into hal_json root file
so that no conflicts will happen between asyncwebserver and syncwebserver


refactor webserver related stuff from HAL_JSON manager to a outside file/class
by creating a HAL_JSON_Manager file/class that take care of what HAL_JSON do now except the webserver stuff
this is even more splitted as now there is CommandExecutor class that takes care of parsing commands whereever they come from
the HAL_JSON_REST only serve a webserver that sends cmds to CommandExecutor which then returns the value

***** implement json reload and print devices commands in CommandExecutor
