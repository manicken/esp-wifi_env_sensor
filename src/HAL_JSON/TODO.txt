Convert all JSON validation errors to use an error code system for improved memory efficiency.
Note: This is partially implementedâ€”currently, F("") strings are used, which keeps the string data in flash memory, so the tradeoff is extra used flash memory.

implement a global defines that can be switched on/off
  #define HAL_JSON_VALIDATE_FAIL_OPERATION continue
  #define HAL_JSON_VALIDATE_FAIL_OPERATION return false
so that "if one fail" -> "all fail" principe can be used"
