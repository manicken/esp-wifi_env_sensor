ExtPeripherals:
 do contain the GPIO assigments for the external modules such as sensors and output devices

Sensors:
 should contain the different sensor tables and to define the names, also which type of sensor it is and to which ExtPeripheral it's connected to

TODO

a external class that binds ExtPeripherals and Sensors together
